# A500KB
This project contains the material related to a custom Amiga 500 Mechanical Keyboard. It features the ability to mount Mitsumi or Cherry switches. The Power, Drive and Caps-Lock LEDs are implemented as 7 individually configurable RGB LEDs. LED configuration is provided by an AmigaOS program that talks to the Keyboard over the regular connection. Headers for two additional low active input sources (e.g. HDD, Network) are also present.

The keyboard may be populated with tactile Mitsumi mechanical switches (E25-33-137) and original A2000/3000/4000 keycaps or A1200.net replica keycaps. It has also been tested with Cherry and KailH switches. The author has not reached out to Keycap manufacturers for a fully Amiga compatible keycap set, though.

## Requirements

- Amiga 500 (obviously)
- Main PCB and Switchplate PCB
- 96 Keyswitches (Mitsumi or Cherry)
- parts (including AT90USB1287, IS32FL3237, diodes, LEDs and passives)
- 3D Printed parts for LED light guides (transparent) and spacers
